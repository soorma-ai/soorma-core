# AI-DLC Audit Log: soorma-core M1 Walking Skeleton

## Initial User Request
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T02:24:31Z
**User Input**: "Using AI-DLC, start the soorma-core part of M1 from the slice brief at soorma-prd/backlog/m1-walking-skeleton.md, specifically its Repositories and sessions section for soorma-core. Target repo is soorma-core (empty, greenfield); put the initiative at soorma-core/aidlc-docs/platform/m1-walking-skeleton/. The PRD is platform-foundations at tag prd-platform-foundations-v1.1; confirm its kind as plane. soorma-sdk is context only, not a target. Commit on dev and open PRs to main. Stop after Requirements Analysis so I can review how the brief's four questions to watch were classified before going further."
**AI Response**: "Displayed the welcome message. Loaded the common rules and the extension opt-in files (jira-tickets, pr-checkpoint, qa-test-cases, security-baseline, soorma-platform-invariants). Started Workspace Detection."
**Context**: Workflow start

## Workspace Detection
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T02:26:06Z
**User Input**: (none; continuing from the initial request)
**AI Response**: "TARGET_REPO_ROOT = soorma-core (named explicitly by the user). INITIATIVE_ROOT = aidlc-docs/platform/m1-walking-skeleton/. Greenfield: no source or build files, only README, LICENSE, CLA, CCLA, CONTRIBUTING, and .github/. soorma-sdk is context only and also empty. aidlc-docs/.gitignore: created (absent before). PRD detection: soorma-prd/aiprd-docs/platform-foundations/requirements/prd.md, named explicitly by the user at tag prd-platform-foundations-v1.1. No existing aidlc-state.md, so this is a new initiative. Branch dev is level with origin/dev and contains origin/main. Next: PRD Intake, then Requirements Analysis."
**Context**: Workspace Detection complete; no approval required

## PRD Intake
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T02:26:06Z
**User Input**: (from the initial request) "The PRD is platform-foundations at tag prd-platform-foundations-v1.1; confirm its kind as plane."
**AI Response**: "Approval state: header Status = Approved, 2026-09-10, via PR #4. Version 1.1 resolves to tag prd-platform-foundations-v1.1 = commit cef399f451e4a3cb0be5bed92586383cbf148afc. Read at the tag, not HEAD. HEAD differs from the tag only by the licence identifier rename FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0 to FSL-1.1-ALv2, which has no build impact. PR #4 review: one review, state COMMENTED, body 'looks good', no inline threads. Nothing outside the body. Kind: the header has no Kind field. Inferred as plane (plane specifications, placement and seams, packaging and edition assignments, invariant compliance) and confirmed by the user's instruction. Open questions: OQ-1 to OQ-14 all Answered at the tag, so none were imported. Open risks R-1 to R-7 recorded. R-2 is touched by M1. Also read at the tag: aiprd-docs/plane-obligations.md (OB-1 to OB-12, which the brief cites), plane-analysis P3 and P4 for re-broadening and grantable-set wording, and references/platform (brief and invariants) for re-broadening semantics. Wrote inception/prd-intake/prd-coverage-map.md with stage coverage, L1 sources, inherited decisions, handover items, risks, and the build-time question classification."
**Context**: PRD Intake. Kind confirmed as plane. Brownfield retrofit assessment N/A (greenfield).

## PRD Intake: Approval Gate Handling
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T02:31:20Z
**User Input**: (from the initial request) "Stop after Requirements Analysis so I can review how the brief's four questions to watch were classified before going further."
**AI Response**: "The user's instruction directs this session through to Requirements Analysis. The PRD Intake approval prompt was therefore not issued as a separate stop. It is carried as Question 1 of requirement-verification-questions.md and stays pending until answered. Intake is not recorded as approved."
**Context**: PRD Intake Step 7 gate, consolidated with the Requirements Analysis question gate

## Requirements Analysis: Intent and Gap Classification
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T02:31:20Z
**User Input**: (none; continuing)
**AI Response**: "Intent: New Project (greenfield), server side of the M1 walking skeleton. Scope: system-wide within soorma-core, and owner of the wire contract that soorma-sdk consumes. Complexity: Complex. Depth: Comprehensive. Classification of the brief's four questions to watch (full entries in prd-coverage-map.md). Q1, human sponsor (Identity): the sponsor is the registering Developer (answered by §12); grantable set = held set (technology interpretation); GAP-INT-001 human principal and control-plane authentication = SPECIFICATION (OB-4); GAP-INT-002 first human grant = SPECIFICATION (OB-3, R-2 Open). Q2, event (Event): topic creation answered by §8a (environment namespace; no topics in M1); subscription lifetime under O2, O3, FR-012 = technology, constrained; GAP-INT-003 delivery guarantees = SPECIFICATION. Q3, trace span (Observability): TECHNOLOGY for soorma-core (W3C Trace Context validation, no spans emitted; span semantics are soorma-sdk's concern for done-when 5). Q4, discovery (Registry & Schema): answered by §8a, subscription only, no gap. Additional, not on the brief's list: GAP-INT-004 re-broadening evaluation rule = SPECIFICATION (FR-017; no layer states it). Errata E-1 (§17 field count, §4 operation count), no build impact. Conclusion: the PRD's §19 claim that M1 needs no invented architectural decision does not hold. GAP-INT-001 and GAP-INT-002 sit at the root of every done-when item. No soorma-prd issues exist yet (checked), so none were duplicated. No issues opened: routing is the user's decision."
**Context**: Requirements Analysis Steps 0 to 5. Gaps registered in aidlc-state.md.

## Requirements Analysis: Questions Issued
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T02:31:20Z
**User Input**: (none)
**AI Response**: "Created inception/requirements/requirement-verification-questions.md (git-ignored) with 14 questions: Q1 intake approval; Q2 to Q5 routing for GAP-INT-001 to GAP-INT-004; Q6 confirmation of the non-gap classifications; Q7 FR-011; Q8 FR-026; Q9 implementation language; Q10 to Q14 extension opt-ins (security baseline, platform invariants, PR checkpoint, QA test cases, JIRA). Stopped at the Step 6 gate, as instructed."
**Context**: Requirements Analysis Step 6 gate. Awaiting user answers.

## Requirements Analysis: Answers Received
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T03:13:21Z
**User Input**: "all questions have been answered"
**AI Response**: "Read requirement-verification-questions.md and set all 14 questions to Answered."

**Answers Recorded** (requirement-verification-questions.md):
- Q1 — PRD intake approval: A — Approve the coverage map as written
- Q2 — Route GAP-INT-001 (human principal and control-plane authentication): A — Raise against soorma-prd, open a `Specification gap from build` issue citing `prd-platform-foundations-v1.1`, and block registration on it
- Q3 — Route GAP-INT-002 (the first human grant, R-2): A — Raise against soorma-prd, in the same issue as GAP-INT-001
- Q4 — Route GAP-INT-003 (event delivery guarantees): E — Both A and D: raise it, and work around it in M1 (live subscribers only; no durability, ordering, or redelivery; the wire contract states delivery semantics are unspecified; the M1 wire contract is published as pre-release) so done-when 3 can be proven
- Q5 — Route GAP-INT-004 (re-broadening evaluation): E — Both A and D: raise it, and build the work-around in M1 (accept only a declaration of none; reject registrations declaring re-broadening; still reject an agent-set re-broadening record)
- Q6 — Confirm the non-gap classifications: C — "C, reclassify T-1, and also ask for the errata issue"
- Q7 — FR-011 revocation initiation: B — Defer initiation. O3 reads revocation state on every request, and tests seed revocation state through a test-only path not compiled into the product
- Q8 — FR-026 seams: B — Internal boundary only: shape the code at both seam lines and honour containment, but publish no interface and offer no configuration selection until a second implementation exists
- Q9 — Implementation language: X — "i'm thinking of starting with typescript using nest.js backend framework, so that end to end implementation can be fullstack in same language. but confirm that this will not have significant drawback for soorma-core itself, when compared to Go, which is considered highly performant for backend and platform services."
- Q10 — Security Extensions: A — Yes, enforce all SECURITY rules as blocking constraints
- Q11 — soorma Platform Invariants: A — Yes, enforce the platform invariants
- Q12 — Team Collaboration Review Gates: A — Enable team review gates
- Q13 — QA Test Cases Extension: A3 — Yes, comprehensive scope (happy path, negative, edge cases, boundary conditions)
- Q14 — JIRA Tickets Extension: X — "X, actually use GitHub issues not jira"

**Context**: Requirements Analysis Step 6. Answers analyzed for contradictions and ambiguities (next entry).

## Requirements Analysis: Answer Analysis
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T03:13:21Z
**User Input**: (none)
**AI Response**: "No contradictions. Three points need clarification before requirements.md is generated. (1) Q6: T-1 (grantable set) is reclassified as specification and becomes GAP-INT-005, but no routing was given for it. (2) Q9: the user asked for confirmation of TypeScript and NestJS against Go before committing to it. (3) Q14: the JIRA extension is to target GitHub issues instead; the mechanism (create real issues versus generate content only) and the target repository are unstated. Actions taken on the unambiguous answers: PRD intake recorded as Approved; extension configuration recorded; full rule files loaded for security-baseline, soorma-platform-invariants, pr-checkpoint, qa-test-cases, and jira-tickets (adapted to GitHub issues); issues opened on soorma-prd for GAP-INT-001+002 (one issue), GAP-INT-003, GAP-INT-004, and the E-1 errata. GAP-INT-005 has no issue yet, pending routing. Invariant scope recorded: inherited from PRD §15, all eleven Addressed, none N/A."
**Context**: Requirements Analysis. Extension rules loaded (Deferred Rule Loading).

## Requirements Analysis: Gaps Raised Against soorma-prd
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T03:15:47Z
**User Input**: (routing from RA Q2 to Q6, recorded above)
**AI Response**: "Checked soorma-prd for existing 'Specification gap from build' issues: none. Opened: soorma-prd#12 (GAP-INT-001 and GAP-INT-002, routing A, blocking); soorma-prd#13 (GAP-INT-003, routing E: raised and worked around); soorma-prd#14 (GAP-INT-004, routing E: raised and worked around); soorma-prd#15 (E-1 errata, label documentation, non-blocking). Each gap issue body carries the gap entry verbatim and the tag prd-platform-foundations-v1.1. Updated prd-coverage-map.md (statuses, issue links, T-1 reclassified as GAP-INT-005) and the aidlc-state.md gap register."
**Context**: prd-gap-classification.md Step 3, option A, for each routed gap

## Requirements Analysis: Clarification Questions Issued
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-05T03:15:47Z
**User Input**: (none)
**AI Response**: "Created inception/requirements/requirement-clarification-questions.md (git-ignored) with 3 questions: (1) routing for GAP-INT-005; (2) the implementation-language decision, with the requested TypeScript/NestJS-against-Go assessment (no significant drawback for M1; moderate, contained costs at scale in per-instance throughput, self-host distribution, and supply-chain surface; reversible if the wire contract is language-neutral, perimeter components are stateless, and dependencies are disciplined); (3) the mechanism and target repository for GitHub issues in place of JIRA. requirements.md is held until these are answered (RA Step 6 gate)."
**Context**: Requirements Analysis Step 6, clarification round

## Requirements Analysis: Clarification Answers
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-06T23:04:21Z
**User Input**: "q1: yes add this to soorma-prd issue #12, just like for other identity plane specification gaps -- confirm if this is right choice and better then choosing #14 or a new issue
q2: lets go with option A, making sure that the 3 conditions are part of the requirements
q3: i think option A is better ... in fact i'd like to not have markdown (if they are not considered durable artifact that will matter 1 year from now) to reduce the amount of files we need to review"
**AI Response**: "Recorded the answers in requirement-clarification-questions.md (all Answered). On Q1 the AI disagrees and has not yet posted. 'Grantable set' (FR-016) is a property of the permission model, which platform-foundations owns (FR-018, minimal model) and Access Policy extends; it is not human principal lifecycle (Identity, OB-3/OB-4). It therefore belongs with GAP-INT-004 in soorma-prd#14, the other platform-foundations authority-algebra gap. Adding a comment to an issue the user did not choose needs the user's confirmation first. On Q2, M1-TECH-01 to 04 are recorded in requirements.md with the three conditions as binding requirements. On Q3, tickets are real GitHub issues on soorma-core with no markdown file. The issues themselves are the durable artifact, and their numbers are recorded in the committed aidlc-state.md, so a separate markdown copy would add review surface without a decision."

**Answers Recorded** (requirement-clarification-questions.md):
- C1 — Routing for GAP-INT-005: C — add to soorma-prd#12 (user asked for confirmation that this beats #14 or a new issue; AI recommends #14; awaiting confirmation)
- C2 — Implementation language: A — TypeScript with NestJS, under the three conditions, which are to be part of the requirements
- C3 — GitHub issues mechanism: A — create real issues on soorma-core (tracking issue plus one sub-issue per unit), with no markdown record

## Requirements Analysis: GAP-INT-005 Routing Confirmed
**Timestamp**: 2026-10-06T23:07:00Z
**User Input**: "ok to use recommendation #14 instead of #12"
**AI Response**: "Answer change logged: C1 — routing for GAP-INT-005 is now soorma-prd#14, not #12. Added the full GAP-INT-005 entry to prd-coverage-map.md (options: grantable = held; a separate grantable set via a grant-option; held minus administrative permissions). Posted it verbatim as a comment on soorma-prd#14 (issuecomment-6027080269). Retitled #14 to 'Specification gaps from build: re-broadening evaluation rule and meaning of \"grantable set\" (GAP-INT-004, GAP-INT-005)'. Updated the aidlc-state.md register and requirements.md section 6. requirements.md is still awaiting approval."
