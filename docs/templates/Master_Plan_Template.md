# Master Plan: [High-Level Feature Name] (SOOR-XXX)

**Status:** 📋 Proposed | 🟢 In Progress | ✅ Completed

## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement
- What is the current bottleneck in the DisCo pattern?
- How does this enhancement improve the developer experience for Soorma users?

## 2. Target Architecture
- **Impact Map:** (sdk | libs | services | examples)
- **Visual Flow:** [Insert Mermaid Diagram showing new event paths or service interactions]
- **DisCo Evolution:** How does this change the relationship between Planner, Worker, and Tool?

## 3. Phased Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Foundation** (Core models in `soorma-common`, Registry updates)
- **Phase 2: Implementation** (Service logic, SDK primitives)
- **Phase 3: Validation** (Complex examples, load testing)

## 4. Risks & Constraints
- **MIT Compliance:** Verify no proprietary dependencies are introduced.
- **48-Hour Filter:** Identify which parts of the roadmap can be deferred or "FDE'd".
